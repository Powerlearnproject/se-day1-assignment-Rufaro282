#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing, and maintaining software and as for the importance, it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications, it also helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards, it ensures the system can handle an increaded load without affecting perfomance, and software development helps implement protection practise like authentication, authorization, and encryption to secure users information.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning- identifying the software requirement or purpose and scope, requirement analysis- identifying the final user specification, design- building the framework, coding- converting software design into tangible code, testing- examine the software for any bugs and glitches.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is linear and sequential and each phase is completed before moving on and agile methodology is iterative and incremental with multiple cycles. 2) waterfall methodology has low flexibility and agile methodology has high flexibility and adapts to changing requirements. 3) waterfall methodology customer feedback comes late, after the profuct is developed and agile methodology regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 4) with waterfall methodology testing is done at the end of the development process and agile methodology testing is contionous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a software developer develops applications, programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks and as for the responsibilities they are maintaining and updating software to keep it functional, collaborating with other team members to ensure best practise when developing software, and reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
a quality assurance engineer collaborates with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement and as for the responsibilities they create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow, confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment, and also analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient and develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
a project manager assembles and leads the software development team and as for the responsibilities, the project manager discusses the project and its requirement with the client and software developers, create blueprint for the project, tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone and deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs contain intelligent features which help to automatically write and edit the source code, an IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using using different font colours which makes the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidentak syntax errors, an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing, IDEs increases programmer productivity by perfoming repeatable developmemt tasks that are typically part of every code change and also an IDE compiles the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand and the examples for IDEs are visual studio code, itellij idea and pycharm.
VCEs enable multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts, VCEs also record detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification, supports craeting branches for new features and merging them back into the main code and VCEs allow reverting to previous versions if new version introduce errors and the examples for VCEs are git hub, subversion and fossil.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challengies: rapid technological adavancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current and as for the solutions software engineers have to adopt continous learning practises and use agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever evolving industry.
Challengies: software engineering is a demanding and time intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under pressure to meet tight deadlines and as for the solutions adopt agile methodologies , such as scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints.
Challengies: software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for enginners to design and develop solutions that meet users needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes and as for the solutions engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability , and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independant components.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests- are close to the source of an application, they consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software and unit tests ensures each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
integration tests- verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together and integration tests help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
system tests- focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions and system testing helps to verify that the system meets all functional and non functional requirements, including performance, usability and security.
acceptance tests- are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements and acceptance tests require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating users behaviour.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs and as for the importance, prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt, it hekps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language training models training data, increased flexibility which means a prompt engineer can create prompts with domain neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns, and also prompt engineering gives developers more control over users interactions with AI.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
